Pure HTML and CSS base Scroll Down animation button. If you are already familiar with HTML you can easily customize this small script as per your needs.

Just look at this part to understand the process:
<pre>
<section id="section-1">
      <a id="scroll-btn" href="#section-2"></a>
</section>
</pre>

Place this <pre><a id="scroll-btn" href="#section-2"></a></pre> in your code to see the magic :)
